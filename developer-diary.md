### 📝 refactor: strongly type the `accountStatus` query - 📅 2025-07-21

**🔗 PR:** [#6572](https://github.com/LegitFit/legitfit/pull/6572)  

**🔍 Summary:**  
Refactored the `accountStatus` query to enforce strong typing by removing the use of `as any` in the User mongoose model.

**📌 Details:**  
Replaced all instances of `as any` with explicit type definitions in the User mongoose model, ensuring that the `accountStatus` query now leverages the project's defined types. This change improves type safety, reduces the risk of runtime errors, and aligns the codebase with TypeScript best practices.

**⚙️ Performance:**  
No direct performance impact, but improved type safety may help prevent future bugs and streamline development workflows.
